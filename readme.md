# Quest GeOOmetry

Everything you did is working

Your classes have to match with this UML diagram :

![geoometry class diagramm](http://images.innoveduc.fr/php_parcours/OOP/geoometry/Geoometry.png 'quest geoometry class diagram')

All your code must work. You can instantiate any Circle, Rectangles and Square, with (almost) any size or any color handle by html you want on index.php. If you try to set negative sizes, an error is thrown.

Validation criteria :

    You can instantiate a rectangle (with width and height mandatory),
    You can instantiate a square (with only width as mandatory),
    You can't instantiate a Shape,
    Error is thrown on negative size value,
    On echo, shapes are visibles,
    No any require or require_once is used anywhere,
    Your code is available on Github.
